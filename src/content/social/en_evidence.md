## Evidence of Climate Change: How Shifting Weather Affects Farmers

This video shows the real effects of climate change in **Boyacá, Colombia**, where **extreme frosts** were recorded at the beginning of 2025.

This region, known for its agricultural activity, suffered such **low temperatures that the pastures dried out.**

Farmers are forced to work under extremely harsh conditions just to grow crops and **earn the money they need to survive.**

In many Latin American countries, **small-scale farmers don’t have pensions or government-subsidized wages when they’re unable to work. They depend entirely on what the land provides.** And when the climate fails, **their entire lives are affected.**
