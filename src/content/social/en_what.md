## What Can We Do About Climate Change?

First, **raise awareness:** climate change is already **affecting thousands of people**—it’s not a distant problem.

We need to **change our lifestyles** and act with more respect for the planet and for the people who rely on it the most.

**Small changes in our daily habits** can make a big difference:

- Consume less and do so more responsibly
- Support local products
- Save energy and water
- Reduce plastic use
- Share information and educate others

**_“Caring for the planet means caring for those who live and work on it. Change begins with us.”_**
