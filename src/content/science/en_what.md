## What am I doing about it?

In my research, I’m working on a solution to remove PFAS from water using **electricity** and **special materials** that help break these substances down.

## What can you do?

- **Learn more and change your consumption habits**. Avoid products with PFAS when you can.
- Read labels — look for **“PFAS-free”** or more natural options.
- Share this info with family and friends. **Together, we can make a difference.**

**Protecting our health and the planet is in our hands.**
