## Have You Heard of PFAS?

You’ve probably never heard that word before… but have you ever used non-stick pans with Teflon? Well, you might be surprised to know that **“Teflon” contains some very dangerous chemicals called PFAS**, which **don’t break down easily** and can stay in the environment **forever**.

But that’s not all — these substances **can get into our bodies** and cause serious health problems like: **cancer, infertility, high cholesterol, thyroid issues**, and more.

And it’s not just pots and pans. PFAS are found in all kinds of everyday products, like:

- Waterproof clothing
- Food packaging (like microwave popcorn bags)
- Long-lasting makeup
- Cleaning and personal care products
- And many more!

**So how do PFAS get into the environment?** When industries make these products, they often use PFAS — and **many don’t properly treat their wastewater**. That means these toxic substances end up in our rivers, soil, crops, and even the air we breathe.

What’s worse is that **water treatment plants can’t remove PFAS**, because they’re so resistant.

**PFAS pollution is growing every day.**
