## What is this project doing?

This project is focused on **finding a way to remove PFAS from contaminated water** using a special type of sponge made from **graphene**, a powerful and modern material.

The idea is to use **electricity and this sponge** to break down different types of PFAS and to **completely destroy the harmful parts** of these chemicals:

- Including the **longer-lasting ones**
- The **smaller and newer ones**
- And even the **most difficult-to-remove kinds**
