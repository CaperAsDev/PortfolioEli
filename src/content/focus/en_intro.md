## What are PFAS and why are they a problem?

**PFAS** are man-made chemicals that have been used since the 1940s in many everyday products. They're often called **"forever chemicals"** because they **don’t break down easily** and **can stay in the environment for a very long time.**

That’s because PFAS are made with a super-strong bond (between carbon and fluorine) that makes them **extremely hard to remove**, even with advanced water treatment systems. Once PFAS are released into the environment, **they stay there—sometimes forever.**
