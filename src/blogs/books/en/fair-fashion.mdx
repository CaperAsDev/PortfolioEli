## Fair Fashion: An Invitation to Dress Ethically

This book invites us to reflect on the negative impact of the fashion industry, the phenomenon of greenwashing, and the serious environmental consequences this activity generates. Through revealing data, it shows us why it is urgent to rethink our clothing choices:

### 1. The fate of discarded clothing

**80% of the clothing discarded in developing countries** ends up in nations such as **Togo, Ghana, Cameroon, India, Benin, and Pakistan**.  
These countries face a **surplus of used clothing** that not only pollutes the environment but also **hinders the development of their own industries and local designs**.

### 2. The polyester problem

**52% of garments produced worldwide contain polyester**, a petroleum derivative that:

- Requires large amounts of energy to manufacture
- Releases toxins
- Sheds microfibers when washed
- Is not biodegradable

### 3. Microplastic pollution

Synthetic fabrics release microplastics during washing, which represent **approximately 35% of ocean pollution**.

### 4. Sustainable alternatives

A more planet-friendly option is to opt for **plant-based fibers with a low environmental impact**.  
For example, **organic linen**:

- Requires little water to grow
- Can thrive even in low-quality soil

### Ethical clothing has a real impact

It not only benefits **industry workers**, but also **ecosystems and animals**, both in our own environment and in places **thousands of miles away**.
