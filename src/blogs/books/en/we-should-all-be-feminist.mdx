# We Should All Be Feminists

**Women** make up approximately **49.5%** of the world's population, while **men** represent **50.5%**. But most **positions of power and prestige** are held by men, "_the higher you go, the fewer women you'll find._" So, literally, **men rule the world**. This reality has **historical roots**: for centuries, **physical strength** was key to survival, and those who possessed it (**primarily men**) dominated social and political systems.

However, we live in a **different world**. Today, **leadership** no longer depends on strength; the most likely person to lead should be the most **creative**, **intelligent**, and **innovative**. And none of these qualities are determined by **gender**.

In this **powerful essay**, Nigerian author **Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie** invites us to rethink **feminism** from an **intersectional** and **urgent perspective**. With **clarity and depth**, she argues about the need to **educate girls and boys about equality** from the earliest ages, challenging the **gender privileges** that, although invisible to many, perpetuate real **inequalities**. This book is not just a reflection, but a **call to action** toward a more **just and equitable world** for all.
