## Evidence of Climate Change: How Shifting Weather Affects Farmers

This video shows the real effects of climate change in **Boyacá, Colombia**, where **extreme frosts** were recorded at the beginning of 2025.

This region, known for its agricultural activity, suffered such **low temperatures that the pastures dried out.**

Farmers are forced to work under extremely harsh conditions just to grow crops and **earn the money they need to survive.**

In many Latin American countries, **small-scale farmers don’t have pensions or government-subsidized wages when they’re unable to work. They depend entirely on what the land provides.** And when the climate fails, **their entire lives are affected.**

## What Can We Do About Climate Change?

First, **raise awareness:** climate change is already **affecting thousands of people**—it’s not a distant problem.

We need to **change our lifestyles** and act with more respect for the planet and for the people who rely on it the most.

**Small changes in our daily habits** can make a big difference:

- Consume less and do so more responsibly
- Support local products
- Save energy and water
- Reduce plastic use
- Share information and educate others

**_“Caring for the planet means caring for those who live and work on it. Change begins with us.”_**
