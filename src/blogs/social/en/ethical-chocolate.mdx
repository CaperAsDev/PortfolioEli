In **West Africa**, where **Ghana** and **Ivory Coast** produce **70%** of the world's **cocoa**, **child labour** remains widespread in the cocoa industry. Millions of **children**, some as young as five, work under **hazardous conditions**, largely due to **extreme poverty** among farmers, who now receive only **6%** of a chocolate bar’s value, compared to **50%** in the 1970s. These children face **dangerous tasks**, including exposure to **harmful chemicals**, limited access to **education**, and the threat of **human trafficking**, which perpetuates their **exploitation**. Attempts at **regulation** and **industry-led initiatives** have largely failed, and certification schemes such as **Fairtrade**, **UTZ**, and **Rainforest Alliance** have proven insufficient. As a result, **consumers** currently have no reliable means of ensuring that their chocolate is **free from child exploitation**.

## How can I contribute to ethical chocolate consumption?

The key is to be **informed** and engage **proactively** as consumers. These strategies include researching chocolate companies for **credible certifications** and consulting **independent resources** like the **Food Empowerment Project**. Consumers are encouraged to create **awareness** by contacting companies, supporting campaigns, and favouring **ethical brands** over those linked to **exploitation**. Additionally, involvement with **organisations** combatting child labour, through **donations**, **sponsorships**, or **volunteering**, can contribute to broader systemic change.
