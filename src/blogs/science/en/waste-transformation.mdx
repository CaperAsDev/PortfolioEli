## Science for a Greener Future

Instead of sending organic waste and materials to landfill, why not consider how nature, particularly microbes found in the environment, can transform this "rubbish" into valuable products such as natural enzymes, nutrients, or even renewable energy.

## Science in Action

In **Bogotá's wetlands**, we have isolated and studied the bacteria in the soil and their ability to break down complex plant matter, or biomass. Correspondingly, we have explored how food waste from in local marketplaces could be used to feed these microbes, enabling them to produce enzymes (enzymes speed up chemical reactions, like specialized “tools”). Notably, these enzymes have a wide range of applications, such as **cleaning toxic substances in the environment.**

    it can be repurposed to extract antioxidant molecules like phenolic
    compounds or to generate renewable energy such as biogas.

## What can you do about it?

Every small effort matters when it comes to protecting our planet! Since around 1.3 billion tonnes of food are wasted globally each year, you can start by reducing food waste at home. For example, by composting, reusing leftovers, or donating excess food to local charities. Support community projects that aim to recycle organic materials or produce renewable energy. If you feel inspired, get involved in sustainability initiatives or advocate for greener policies. **Together, we can make a meaningful difference for the environment and future generations!**
