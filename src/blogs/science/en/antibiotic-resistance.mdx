Have you heard of **antibiotic resistance**?

Maybe that term isn't familiar to you... but you're definitely familiar with **antibiotics**, right? Those medicines we take when we have an **infection**. Well, antibiotics are no longer working. Why? Because many **bacteria** are becoming **resistant**. This means that even if we take the medication, it no longer works.

And this is very serious. **Infections** that were once easy to cure can now last longer, cause complications, or even be **fatal**. Did you know that thousands of people die each year from infections that don't respond to antibiotics? And if we don't act, by **2050** more people could die from resistance than from cancer.

## How did we get to this point?

- From taking **antibiotics without a prescription** or when we don't need them.
- From not completing the **full course of treatment**.
- From overusing antibiotics in **farm animals**.
- Due to **poor hygiene** and lack of access to clean water and sanitation.

## What am I doing?

In my **research**, I study the presence of **antibiotic resistance genes** in the **water** that comes out of our homes, hospitals, and streets. Through a **wastewater-based epidemiology** approach, we seek to understand how these genes are distributed in different areas of the city and how they relate to **social and economic** factors. This information can help us detect risks and improve **prevention**.

## What can you do?

- Do not take **antibiotics without a prescription**.
- Always follow the **full course of treatment**.
- Maintain **good hygiene**.
- Share this **information**.

Resistance is a **global problem**, but together we can make a difference.
