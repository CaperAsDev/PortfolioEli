## Thousands of years ago

Thousands of years ago, humans developed **wastewater channeling systems** to move it away from cities, since we have long been aware of its **potential to spread infectious diseases**. Wastewater carries the excreta of an entire population, and with them, the bacteria that live in the human body: the **microbiota**.

The microbiota is like a community of **tiny living things** (mostly bacteria, but also viruses, fungi, and other microbes) that live in and on our bodies, especially in our **gut**.

**Example:** Imagine your gut as a **big garden**. The microbiota are all the plants and little creatures living in that garden. Some help the garden grow healthy (**like helping you digest food or protect you from bad germs**), while others can cause trouble if they grow too much.

That is why wastewater not only represents a **contagion risk**, but also a **valuable source of information**. It is like taking biological samples from an **entire community at once**. This perspective has given rise to an emerging field known as **wastewater-based epidemiology**, which allows for the **monitoring and detection of infectious disease outbreaks** in an effective and cost-efficient way. During the **COVID-19 pandemic**, this approach was used to **monitor entire cities without the need for individual clinical testing**, which facilitated public health decisions such as **mobility restrictions**.

## Beyond emergencies

Beyond emergency situations like those experienced between 2020 and 2022, wastewater monitoring continues to be useful for **tracking pathogens** that are still circulating despite vaccine control, or for **detecting the presence of genes associated with antibiotic resistance**, a growing threat to **global health**. One of its advantages is the ability to **adjust the sampling scale**, which can range from **intra-urban or even building-level monitoring to entire cities**, allowing focus on key areas.

## Surveillance techniques

The techniques used for microbiological surveillance are diverse, from **classic microorganism cultures** to more advanced molecular methods such as **gene amplification** or **massive sequencing**. These tools allow us to analyze in detail the **microscopic life** that has found its niche in sewer systems, turning what was once only **waste into a powerful tool for epidemiological surveillance**.

## What do I do?

In my doctoral thesis, I research the **set of antibiotic resistance genes** present in wastewater from different communities.
