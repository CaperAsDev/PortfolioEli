## Did you know that rivers can be full of invisible dangers?

**River contamination** is a **global problem** that often goes unnoticed. In **Brazil**, many rivers suffer from untreated sewage, pesticides, and **pharmaceutical residues**. Around the world, the situation is similar: pollution from different industries, plastics, and chemicals is **threatening water quality**.  
Medicines, pesticides, and many other contaminants have already been detected in rivers across the globe. Even in very small amounts, these contaminants can **greatly impact** water quality and the **environment** as a whole.

    River pollution does not remain ‚Äútrapped‚Äù in the water‚Äîit comes back to us in
    the form of **health risks**, food loss, and **damage to nature**.

Remember: **water is essential** for our existence, and its contamination can become
a **major risk** to human health! Taking care of rivers is taking care of **our lives**!

## What can you do?

In this sense, even **small everyday actions** make a **big difference**‚Äîeach of us can be responsible for change:

### In daily life:

- üöØ Do not throw **trash on the streets**, it can be carried by rain into rivers.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Separate and recycle waste**‚Äîplastic, glass, and metals take centuries to decompose.
- üöΩ Properly dispose of **cooking oil**, medicines, and chemicals‚Äînever down the drain or toilet.
- üß¥ Use fewer **cleaning products** and cosmetics with harsh chemicals, choose biodegradable versions instead.
- üå± Give preference to consuming **foods produced** without the use of pesticides.

### In consumption:

- üí° **Save water**, less sewage ends up in rivers.
- üçÉ Support companies that **respect the environment**.
- üõçÔ∏è **Reduce** the use of single-use plastics.

### Collectively:

- üå≥ Join **river clean-up efforts** or organize one in your community!
- ‚úä Join **collective campaigns** that fight for the ban on pesticides.
- üì¢ **Demand proper sanitation** and wastewater treatment from authorities.
- üë©‚Äçüè´ **Share information**‚Äîthe more people know, the greater the positive impact.

> You may not be able to **change the world** alone, but you can start with your **community**!  
> Spread **good actions**, the results will be **surprising**, believe it!
