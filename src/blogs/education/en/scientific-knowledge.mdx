**The COVID-19 pandemic**, declared in **2020**, highlighted the importance of **scientific knowledge** in **everyday life**. The population, exposed to an **avalanche of information** regarding **transmission**, **prevention**, **diagnosis**, and the **origin of the virus**, became familiar with terms previously exclusive to the academic sphere, such as:

- **PCR tests**
- **Antigens**
- **Mutations**
- **Messenger RNA (mRNA)**
- **Viral vectors**
- **Vaccine efficacy**

**Science** ceased to be a matter reserved for specialists and became a **public necessity**, demonstrating its **usefulness** beyond academic settings.

This **global phenomenon** underscores the need to bring **scientific knowledge** closer to **citizens**, emphasizing its **relevance** in **current contexts**. With this goal in mind, it is proposed to use the **classroom** as a space for **applied scientific education**, where students create **scientific outreach formats** such as:

- **Comic strips**
- **Drawings**
- **Videos**
- **Short stories**
- **Posters**
- **Illustrations**

These productions allow young people to **take ownership of scientific language** and become **active communicators** of what they have learned, sharing knowledge with their **families and communities**.

    our talents and use drawing as a universal means of communication.

Thus, the **school** becomes a **dynamic center** for the **production of knowledge** that **transcends its walls**, promoting **public understanding of science**. In a context of **misinformation** and **polarization**, training **citizens capable of interpreting and communicating scientific knowledge** is crucial. The development of **outreach materials** not only promotes the **appropriation of knowledge** but also strengthens **critical and active participation** in society.

    curriculum in the functions and properties of everyday products so that
    others can learn what we have learned and identify the role of science in
    daily life.

In this way, the aim is to **consolidate the vision of science** as a **cultural product**, **accessible to all** and **fundamental** for making **informed decisions** in **daily life**. The school **transcends its physical space**, and what is built there is created **with, by, and for the communities**, with the purpose of promoting **public understanding of science**.
