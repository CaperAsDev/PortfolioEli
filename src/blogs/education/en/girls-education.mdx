According to **UNICEF¹**, **122 million girls worldwide are out of school**. While nearly half of countries (49%) have achieved gender parity in primary education, the gap grows larger as girls get older. Only **42% of countries have reached parity in lower secondary education**, and just **24% at the upper secondary level.**

The situation is especially severe in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence. In these areas, **girls are 2.5 times more likely to be out of school than boys** and **90% more likely to miss out on secondary education** compared to girls in more stable countries **(World Bank²)**.

The **COVID-19 pandemic has deepened these inequalities**, disrupting girls’ education, health, and well-being. Many girls have not returned to school, and rising levels of **violence against women and girls** during the pandemic have further threatened their safety and future.

But girls’ education is about more than just access to school. It's about **safe, inclusive learning environments** where girls are supported in choosing subjects and careers they’re passionate about.

**Gender-equitable education systems** don’t just benefit girls—they empower all students. They help young people develop essential life skills like:

- **Communication**
- **Self-management**
- **Critical thinking**
- **Negotiation**

Skills that are crucial not only for personal success but also for building stronger, more prosperous societies.
