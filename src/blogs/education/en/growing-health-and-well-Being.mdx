Every day, the **news** and **social media** show us problems like:

- **Trash** polluting the oceans,
- **Social inequality**,
- Many people with health problems like **obesity** and **diabetes**,
- And at the same time, many others suffer from **hunger** and **poor nutrition**.

Because of this, **schools** should start projects that help children live **healthier** and more **responsible lives** from a young age. That’s why the project called "**Growing Health and Well-Being: The School Garden as a Tool to Promote Healthy Lifestyles**" was created. This project is done with students in the rural school of **Guasimal (Tena, Cundinamarca)**. The goal is to help students live **healthy** and **sustainable** lives.

In this project, children learn by **planting**, **taking care of**, and **harvesting** fruits and vegetables in a **school garden**. While doing this, they learn:

- Why **eating healthy** is important,
- How to **take care of the environment**,
- And how to work **together** with others.

This kind of learning helps students grow in many ways. It teaches them to eat better and use what **nature** gives them. It’s surprising that even in areas full of **fresh fruits and vegetables**, many families still give children **highly processed snacks**. These foods are not only **unhealthy** but also **bad for the planet** because they create a lot of pollution.

Thanks to the **school garden project**, students learn to make **better choices** early in life. They understand how to take care of **nature** and their own bodies. And they can also share what they learn with their **families and communities**.
