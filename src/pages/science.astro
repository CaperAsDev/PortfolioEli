          <h2 class="pfas-title">Have You Heard of PFAS?</h2>
          <p>
            You’ve probably never heard that word before… but have you ever used
            non-stick pans with Teflon? Well, you might be surprised to know
            that <strong
              >“Teflon” contains some very dangerous chemicals called PFAS</strong
            >, which <strong>don’t break down easily</strong> and can stay in the
            environment
            <strong>forever</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that’s not all — these substances <strong
              >can get into our bodies</strong
            > and cause serious health problems like:
            <strong
              >cancer, infertility, high cholesterol, thyroid issues</strong
            >, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it’s not just pots and pans. PFAS are found in all kinds of
            everyday products, like:
          </p>
          <ul class="pfas-list">
            <li>Waterproof clothing</li>
            <li>Food packaging (like microwave popcorn bags)</li>
            <li>Long-lasting makeup</li>
            <li>Cleaning and personal care products</li>
            <li>And many more!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>So how do PFAS get into the environment?</strong> When industries
            make these products, they often use PFAS — and <strong
              >many don’t properly treat their wastewater</strong
            >. That means these toxic substances end up in our rivers, soil,
            crops, and even the air we breathe.
          </p>
          <p>
            What’s worse is that <strong
              >water treatment plants can’t remove PFAS</strong
            >, because they’re so resistant.
          </p>
          <strong class="pfas-warning"
            >PFAS pollution is growing every day.</strong

          <h2 class="pfas-title">What am I doing about it?</h2>
          <p>
            In my research, I’m working on a solution to remove PFAS from water
            using <strong>electricity</strong>
            and <strong>special materials</strong> that help break these substances
            down.

            <li>
              <strong>Learn more and change your consumption habits</strong>.
              Avoid products with PFAS when you can.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read labels — look for <strong>“PFAS-free”</strong> or more natural
              options.
