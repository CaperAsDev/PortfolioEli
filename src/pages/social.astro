          Evidence of Climate Change: How Shifting Weather Affects Farmers
        </h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            This video shows the real effects of climate change in <strong
              >Boyacá, Colombia</strong
            >, where <strong>extreme frosts</strong> were recorded at the beginning
            of 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            This region, known for its agricultural activity, suffered such <strong
              >low temperatures that the pastures dried out.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Farmers are forced to work under extremely harsh conditions just to
            grow crops and <strong>earn the money they need to survive.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In many Latin American countries, <strong
              >small-scale farmers don’t have pensions or government-subsidized
              wages when they’re unable to work. They depend entirely on what
              the land provides.</strong
            > And when the climate fails, <strong
              >their entire lives are affected.</strong
            >

        <h2>What Can We Do About Climate Change?</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            First, <strong>raise awareness:</strong> climate change is already <strong
              >affecting thousands of people</strong
            >—it’s not a distant problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to <strong>change our lifestyles</strong> and act with more respect
            for the planet and for the people who rely on it the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Small changes in our daily habits</strong> can make a big difference:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consume less and do so more responsibly</li>
            <li>Support local products</li>
            <li>Save energy and water</li>
            <li>Reduce plastic use</li>
            <li>Share information and educate others</li>
          </ul>
